STRUGGLE FOR THE CONTINENT

        Have you ever wondered how World War I might have turned out if
   circumstances had been different?  That, essentially, is what this game
   is about.  Some fool got ahold of a time machine and decided he would
   change the course of events of 1914 for his Ph.D. dissertation.  You
   are taking the place of some of the European rulers of the time and are
   faced with a situation of all-out war.  Two alliances face off against
   one another, just as happened the last time.  History does indeed
   repeat itself.

                                  1: SETUP

 1  This is organized to be a game of allies.  Thus, victories are the
    result of teamwork between allied nations.
 2  Each country begins with a certain number of armies, which its player
    stations within the country as he/she sees fit.  However, at least
    one army must be stationed at the capital before play.  Once play
    has begun, this requirement no longer applies.
 3  Since the game is organized along team rather than individual lines,
    equality among players is not necessary.  What is advisable instead
    is a relative equality between the two teams.
 4  The first team to move does not mobilize on its first turn.
 5  For purposes of the game, Serbia and Montenegro are so closely allied
    that they are treated as the same country.  Thus, Montenegro is a part
    of Serbia and is administered by the player who controls Serbia.

							     2: MOVEMENT

   1  Each army can make up to 2 moves per turn.
   2  Moving across a province counts as a move.
   3  Attacking counts as a move.  Thus, an army cannot move across two
      provinces and attack the second one.
   4  Defending against an attack does not count as movement.
   5  Retreat from a battle does not count as a move.
   6  Armies may move freely into (or through) provinces belonging to
      an ally.  They may do the same with enemy territory--unless there
      are troops present in the province(s) in question.
   7  Provinces connected by dotted lines across bodies of water are
      considered to border one another.
   8  Provinces connected by only a point--such as Transylvania and
      Bucharest--are NOT considered to border one another.
   9  Luxembourg and the Saudi kingdom are impassable.

                           3: NUMBER OF ARMIES

   1  Each country begins with a specific number of armies: Italy six,
      Austria nine, and so forth.
   2  Each country mobilizes a certain number of armies at the beginning
      of its turn.
   3  Once a country has mobilized its total number of armies--regardless
      of the number it has on the board--it may mobilize no more armies.
   4  All armies are mobilized at a nation's capital.  Thus, if one side
      takes an enemy's capital, that country may not mobilize so long as
      its capital is occupied.  However, if the country or its allies
      retake the capital, and the country still retains armies on the
      board, it may mobilize normally once again.
   5  If a country has mobilized and lost all its armies in combat, or if
      its capital is occupied by enemy forces and it has no armies left
      on the board, it is defeated and out of the game.

                                4: COMBAT

   1  Combat proceeds in waves, with one line of armies lined up against
      the other.  Individual combat occurs between those individual armies
      that face one another.
   2  An attacker or defender may retreat between waves.  Both sides will
      be asked at that time whether they wish to continue fighting.
   3  The opposing armies compare their attack values to determine tactical
      advantage for the battle.  Example: 2 French, 2 English, and 3 German
      armies engage in combat.  The German armies [5] have a +2 advantage
      over the British [3] but only a +1 advantage over the French [4].
   4  The computer generates a random number of 1 to 10 for each side of
      an individual combat.  The tactical advantage is added in and the
      losing army is then removed.  Ties result in a standoff between the
      two armies, with neither being removed during that wave.

                          4: COMBAT -- Continued

   5  During a battle, when one army defeats another, all its allies in
      combat subtract one from their attack values.  Example:

        2 German and 3 Austrian armies engage 2 Rumanian and 5 Russian
        armies.  The Germans [5] attack the Rumanians [2], and the
        Austrians [2] go after the Russians [1].

      The German armies have an initial advantage of 3 and the Austrians
      one of 1.  The first German army defeats a Rumanian unit, giving the
      next German an advantage of only 2 and making the Austrians equal to
      the Russians.  The next German army also defeats a Rumanian.  These
      two German victories have cost the Austrians 2 points, and the
      Russians actually have an advantage of 1 over them.

                           4: COMBAT -- Continued

   Now -- the Austrians facing Russian armies with 2 points on their side:

      The Russians [1] have a +1 advantage over the Austrians [2] because
      of the difference in combat losses so far.  Combat resumes.

      The first Austrian beats a Russian army, leaving its partner with a
      penalty of 2 versus its Russian opponent.  The second Austrian army
      attacks and loses.  There are now 4 Russian units left to face 2
      Germans and an Austrian.  Though the Germans [5] would ordinarily
      have a +4 advantage against the Russians [1], the Russians' side
      suffered two more defeats than the Germans and Austrians, so
      the Germans have only an advantage of 2.  The Austrians, again,
      have a -1 penalty against them.  Note: these adjustments do not
      apply to later battles.


                          5: ADDITIONAL ALLIES

   1  There will likely come a time in the game when a team has been weak-
      ened to the point that its defeat is all but insured.  At this time
      it may ask a neutral nation of its choice to join the war effort.
      There is a one in three chance that the country will accept.
   2  The country to be asked must border an enemy of the asking team.
   3  Only one country may be called on per turn.
   4  Only a team's group leader (first to move) may ask a neutral to join.
   5  In order to ask a state to join, all players on the team must for-
      feit their turn, although each country will still mobilize armies.
   6  A team should not be visibly stronger than the other if it is to
      ask for aid.  Nor should the country called upon be overwhelmingly
      stronger than the entire opposing team.
   7  A state that enters the war will be set up, as the others were at
      the beginning, and the game continues.

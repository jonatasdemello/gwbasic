The Program of the Month *(July 2017)*

## The good old days

Two weeks ago, we are sitting in the coffee corner with my good friends Maxime and Marcel.
We are enjoying the rare phenomenon of sunshine in the Netherlands, and reminisce about
our geeky childhoods...

Marcel recounts his TRS-80 and ATARI ST exploits; and the rockets he launched!

Maxime describes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel" target="_blank">Minitel</a>
and PC speaker music; his BBS; and watching PC demos while listening to his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravis_Ultrasound" target="_blank">Gravis Ultrasound</a>.

I rant about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_16K.2F48K"
target="_blank">ZX Spectrum</a> and my *(bordering on insanity)* obsession on the Z80
and the Speccy's ROM. Then, after entering the Uni, my switch to the world of 8086... 
I describe the agonizing process of connecting to the *(so few, at the
time!)* university modems - from where the treasures of the demoscene could be
obtained at top speed, via `sz`. And share the shocking experience of my first
sound card - listening late into the night to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qFQBcsUOWc&index=7&list=RDDmhtc5S4atU"
target="_blank">Purple Motion and Skaven</a>, while watching Future Crew's Unreal - again
and again...

Ah, those were the days.

And then I remember my first "publication". I tell my friends about how
a Greek PC magazine at the time *(26 years ago!)* accepted a GW BASIC hack 
I did as the *"Program of the Month"*; and bundled it on the cover 5 1/4 floppy
disk.

But - I have no proof of that anymore! That code is forever lost...

"Perhaps not", says Maxime.

Many French magazines of that era have been scanned nowadays; "Have you searched?
Maybe the same has happened to your magazine as well..."

## Could it be?

I return home, boot up my Arch Linux and search for *"PC Master pdf"* - asking
Google for pages with Greek results only.

What!

Some people have indeed scanned <a href="http://www.iamretro.gr/pc-master/"
target="_blank">all 150 first issues of the magazine</a>, with the official blessing
of the company that published it behind them!...

Oh God. 

I register on the site... but what should I download? There are no covers here,
and I don't remember the issue number!

I can easily write a one-liner to download all 150 of those .rar files,
but that would be rude; these people gave me a gift, I am not going to abuse it.

I search again for "εξώφυλλα" (covers) of PC Master... and Google obliges:

<img src="covers.png" alt="PC Master covers">

<br>
There! Some other kind soul has scanned many of the magazine's covers - and amongst
many missing issues, the one with the big-headed Alien makes my subconscious scream -

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *"That's it!"*

PC Master, issue 24, November 1991.

## Oh God, oh God...

Downloading that .rar file...

And there, there it is - they have uploaded the bundled diskette code!

That `ANIMATOR.BAS` is **mine**!

My own.

My... precious!

...

I open the .pdf - and sure enough, there it is; *"Eternal Glory"* :-)

<img src="glory.jpg" alt="PC Master glory">

<br>
I have to - no, *I need* to run this!

<a href="https://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank">DOSBOX!</a> Now, now, now!

...

Oh wait - I also need GWBASIC...

Google, give me GW BASIC!

...

Will it work?

DOSBOX doesn't render Greek DOS codepages by default *(of course not! what was it?
something about `codepage prepare`?)*

Nah, never mind - I can't be bothered to hunt that down right now!

Run! Run! Run!

<em>Ecstasy. Bliss. Heaven.</em>

There's something in my eye.

Look away... :-)

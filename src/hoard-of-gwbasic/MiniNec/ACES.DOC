		     APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETICS SOCIETY

				       & NEWSLETTER




	      INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

		   The first issue of the ACES Newsletter on numerical
	      modeling in electromagnetics was published in February,
	      1986.  Pre-paid subsciptions will run one year from the date
	      of the first issue, and will include a minimum of two
	      issues.  Other subscriptions will begin with the next issue
	      and will also run for one year.  Back issues of the
	      Newsletter may be ordered until the supply has been
	      exhausted at a price of $15.00 per copy.	A limited supply
	      of 1986 Conference Proceedings are available for $35.00 per
	      copy.

		   Motivation for both the Newsletter and the Society
	      stems from the fact that, over the past ten years or so,
	      computer modeling has matured as a problem-solving tool in
	      real-world electromagnetics applications.  Use of computer
	      modeling has become so routine that sessions at the various
	      professional society meetings deal primarily with new
	      developments, as also do most of the articles found in the
	      technical literature.  As a result, those areas where
	      modeling is routinely used are not highlighted, and
	      information exchange among the practitioners (both users and
	      developers) is inhibited.

		   Consequently, it seems worthwhile to explore
	      alternatives that could provide a forum for those working in
	      applications of computer modeling in electromagnetics.
	      Response to our first meeting "The First Annual NEC Review"
	      (130+ attendance and over 40 presentations) held at Lawrence
	      Livermore National Laboratory in March 1985, and our second
	      meeting "The Second Annual Review of Progress in Applied
	      Computational Electromagnetics" (100+ attendance and nearly
	      50 presentations) held at the Naval Postgraduate School
	      shows that there is a need for an applications forum, and
	      the consensus was that both a regular meeting and a
	      publication were appropriate.  The Newsletter is the initial
	      phase of a publication that we expect to become a journal
	      under the aegis of the Applied Computational
	      Electromagnetics Society.  This organization is now being
	      formally chartered, having had a constitution and by-laws
	      adopted at the Monterey Meeting along with a slate of
	      officers.  Membership in ACES can be attained through either
	      attending an annual meeting, or by payment of a membership
	      fee (see below).	Corporate membership includes Newsletter
	      reproduction rights (for internal use) and a listing in each
	      Newsletter issue.

	      NEWSLETTER GOALS AND ORGANIZATION

		   The overall goal of ACES is to foster information
	      exchange among computer modelers in electromagnetics.  The
	      focus of ACES is on computer-applications issues as opposed
	      to the research and development emphasis provided by other
	      societies and media.  In order to promote this goal and
	      focus, the ACES Newsletter/Journal will be organized as
	      follows:
		   1.  There will be several regular departments or
	      features to appear in the Newsletter including--
		   --A modeling column that will contain announcements of
	      general interest such as problems and limitations discovered
	      in codes and fixes developed thereto, enhancements and
	      improvements added, innovative applications discovered, and
	      new codes available.
		  --Applications notes, to consist of an
	      introductory summary which describes in 1-2 pages the
	      problem, the approach used, the results obtained, and
	      conclusions and recommendations, followed by a maximum of 8-
	      10 pages which provide more detail, including results and
	      validation thereof.
		   --Code descriptions which briefly describe new codes
	      that have become available.
		   --Tutorial articles that give an introduction/overview
	      of various modeling topics from an applications viewpoint,
	      covering material likely to help the modeler do more
	      accurate, efficient and reliable modeling.
		   --An ACES column to provide news of Society activities.

		   2.  Material published in the Newsletter will be so
	      organized that as subsequent Newsletters become available,
	      the various sections can be removed to be kept in a common
	      binder, thus allowing various subjects (applications notes
	      for example) to be accumulated as a separate reference
	      document.  This topic-oriented organization of the
	      Newsletter material should provide a more useful way to
	      collect information than the chronological format used by
	      most journals.

		   3.  For the ease and convenience of both the readers
	      and contributors to the Newsletter, standard formats will be
	      adopted wherever possible for providing material for
	      inclusion.  By requiring an application-note summary to
	      contain specific information in a particular order, the
	      reader can always be sure of what the note's minimum
	      content will be, and the authors will not have to design
	      their own format.

	      ARTICLE-PUBLICATION CRITERIA

		   Finally, because the ACES Newsletter/Journal is
	      intended to deal with applications, each contribution will
	      be required to satisfy at least one of the following
	      criteria to be considered for publication:

		   1.  Code validation.  This may be done using
	      experimental, analytical or computational data.

		   2.  Code applications to design.  This could include
	      studies of parameter sensitivity tradeoffs for the purpose
	      of tabulating handbook-type data or achieving some desired
	      performance.

		   3.  Code studies of basic physics.  This might involve
	      using a code to simulate reality in such a way that better
	      or new physical insight or understanding is achieved.

		   4.  Code enhancements and fixes.  This category is self
	      explanatory, but could cover significant changes to existing
	      codes, including extending their applicability or improving
	      their performance, and correcting problems or removing
	      limitations.

	      SUBMITTAL OF MATERIAL FOR THE ACES NEWSLETTER

		   In preparing material for submittal to the ACES
	      Newsletter, please keep the following guidelines in mind.

	      APPLICATIONS NOTES

	      FORMAT

		   During the start-up phase of the ACES Newsletter, and
	      for the forseeable future thereafter, we plan to employ
	      camera-ready final copy because of the cost savings and
	      convenience it provides.	Please follow the guidelines used
	      by the IEEE Antenna and Propagation Society Newsletter which
	      are paraphrased below.
		   "...Materials intended for publication in the
	      Newsletter should be typed single-space in photo-ready
	      condition--all typing must be kept within a 4 1/2 inch
	      column width.  Any plain white paper can be used but special
	      paper with light blue column guidelines such as can be
	      obtained from the IEEE Headquarters for its Newsletters is
	      convenient.  An alternative method is to type on plain bond
	      paper using heavy black guidelines on a back-up sheet..."

	      CONTENT

		   In order to ensure an appropriate level of quality
	      control and review, contributions for the Applications Notes
	      will be refereed.  We intend to have the Associate Editors
	      perform this function whenever possible in order to reduce
	      time delays in publication.  Contributions will be reviewed
	      both for technical correctness and for adherence to the
	      guidelines listed above with respect to information content.
	      Contributors might therefore want to submit the initial
	      manuscript in draft form so that any suggested changes can
	      be made before the photo-ready copy is prepared.

	      STYLE

		   Although it is our intention to be reasonably flexible
	      with espect to the style of the applications articles which
	      appear in the ACES Newsletter, it is advisable to provide
	      some guidelines.	We suggest that article preparation with
	      respect to equations, referencing and layout follow that of
	      Radio Science.  In particular, equation numbers are put in
	      parentheses at the right column margin, and references are
	      given by author(s) name and year in the body of the article
	      and listed in alphabetical order at the end.

	      OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS

		   Contributions of other kinds are also welcomed.  These
	      include items for the modeling column, code descriptions and
	      suggested topics for the tutorial articles.
